# I. PROJECT OVERVIEW
<p align="justify">

The purpose of the Typing Speed Tester system is to improve individuals' typing proficiency and provide a measurable assessment of their typing speed and accuracy. By offering real-time feedback and tracking progress over time, the system helps users identify areas for improvement, enabling them to increase their typing efficiency. This supports the broader goal of enhancing productivity in both personal and professional settings, where fast and accurate typing is crucial. The system contributes to users' overall skill development by offering a structured approach to practice, while also helping organizations assess and refine their employees' typing capabilities.

# II. PYTHON CONCEPTS AND LIBRARIES

<p align="justify">

**Python Tkinter**

Tkinter is a Python library that allows to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for applications. It provides a range of widgets, like buttons, labels, and text fields, that enable user interaction.
Since Tkinter is event-driven, it reacts to user actions and includes layout management options such as pack(), grid(), and place() for arranging elements in the UI. 
In this application, Tkinter is used to set up the main window, handle user inputs, and switch between different screens, such as the login, registration, and typing game sections. Widgets like labels, buttons, entry fields, and text boxes display information and capture user input, while event handling, frames for organizing elements, 
and back buttons ensure a smooth navigation experience.

**MySQL**

In the Typing Speed Tester, MySQL is essential for handling and storing user data, typing scores, and other important information.
It stores details like usernames, passwords, and typing performance metrics such as words per minute (WPM) and accuracy. The database is used to securely store these records, enabling users to log in, monitor their progress, and access previous scores. 
The program communicates with MySQL to add new user records during registration, retrieve data for logins, and modify or remove records as necessary.
